        <h1>Progression</h1>
        <p>When you start the game, you may be distracted by the opportunity to get a lot of legendary schematics or to trade for legendary weapons. The problem with this strategy, however, is that many legendary schematics cannot be used effectively in the early game.</p>
        <div class="info">
            <p>To check your maximum effective weapon level, go to your heroes tab, hit LS to see all stats, and scroll down to combat to find the maximum power level your hero can use.</p>
        </div>
        <p>In order to make sure that you are using weapons and heroes effectively, use this graph to find what you should be using.</p>
