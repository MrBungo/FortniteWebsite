        <h1>Combat</h1>
        <h2>Starters</h2>
        <p>Ah, combat. The bread and butter of any shooter game. Even in Fortnite, when building is so important, your survival ultimately comes down to your ability to grow and master your aresenal. With as many weapons as there are available in this game, it can be hard to find which ones are the best as you gain the weapon schematics and the ability to craft them.</p>
        <p>Combat comes down to a few different factors: the weapons you have, their level, your playstyle, and the meta.</p>
        <div class="info">
            <p>For those who don't know, the meta is the weapons that are the most powerful at the time, and how they are most effectively used.</p>
            <p>Consistently having weapons in the meta can be difficult and requires time and effort, but can greatly increase your combat effectiveness.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Use of Weapons</h2>
        <p>The different types of weapons in the game best fit certain playstyles. If you like to run and gun, doing as much damage as possible, use an assault rifle and a shotgun. (These weapons are generally the meta.) To kill Mist Monsters, pistols are generally the best suited, and can be augmented with sniper rifles. Melee weapons are generally not a great choice, and rarely make the meta, but can be helpful if you are running low on materials to craft ammo.</p>
        <p>Assault rifles are the go-to, powerful weapon that can be used in many scenarios.</p>
