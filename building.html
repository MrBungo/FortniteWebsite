        <h1>Build Guides</h1>
        <p>No matter what the mission is, if you're defending an objective, <span class="warning">you need to build defenses around it.</span> The goal of this page is to show the most efficient and effective defenses to build around objectives.</p>
        <h2>Building Around an Objective</h2>
        <p>The way you build immediately surrounding the objective is one of the most important aspects of the defense stage. If all else fails, this build will keep the objective safe, and without it, it is susceptible to major damage.</p>
        <div class="info">
            <p>The constuctor class provides a massive boost to building. Use the BASE ability to make your structures much more powerful and gain special perks.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>The Pyramid</h3>
        <p>One of the simplest builds to do is to put a simple pyramid around the objective. This can be accomplished by placing trianges all around the structure, editing them to come to a point, and then placing another triange/floor on top of the objective to creat the pyramid. If done right, ememies should have to walk all the way up the pyramid before they attempt to attack the building.</p>

        <h3>The Inverse-Pyramid</h3>
        <p>This build is mostly used if your objective cannot be built on top of, like a Retrieve the Data or Repair the Shelter mission. Start by putting walls all around the site you are trying to defend. Then, place triangles all around these walls. This time, instead of angling the triangles towards the objective, angle them away. Place floors all around the area, and, if you can afford it, floor launchers on these floors. That way, if enemies get to the objective, they will hit the 45&#176; angle and be flung away. You still should add a simple roof on top of the objective to stop it from being hit by Lobbers and Flingers.</p>

        <h3>Trap Tunnels</h3>

        <p><span class="warning">The most important part of defending any objective.</span> If you can kill all of the enemies quickly, you don't have to worry about the objective.</p>
        <p>The basic idea of a trap tunnel revolves around funnelling enemies into a path that you pre-determine, and using traps to kill them effectively.</p>
        <p>To start, find the enemy spawn locations. These are marked by purple spires that may flash lightning around them.</p>
        <div class="info">
            <p>Be careful building near these spawn points. If you build too close, the storm will destroy these buildings if they are too close.</p>
            <p>Instead of building at the spawn point, build at a point that the husks will be going to.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Now, you will have to find a point to build your trap tunnel that should be able to condense the enemies from multiple nearby spawn points into a single kill zone. You can use walls to guide the enemies into the tunnel, but keep in mind the husk pathing AI. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FORTnITE/comments/9e2jpd/husk_pathing_the_detailed_guide_you_never_asked/">Click here for more info on husk pathing.</a></p>
        <p>Now that you have created a way to funnel the husks into the tunnel, you want to load it up with traps. From my personal experience, ceiling gas traps on the roof, wall dynamos or wall darts on the walls, and <em>wooden floor spikes</em> (not retractable floor spikes) on the ground.</p>
        <p>An optional addition to your trap tunnel is a "time out room." This knocks husks into a seperate room that does a large amount of damage.</p>
        <p>To set this up, use a wall launcher to knock the husks into the seperate room, and load that room up with traps.</p>

        <div class="info">
        <p>An important thing to note is that Propane Huskies and Smashers might destroy your tunnel if they can see you. To avoid this, stand in the back and pick off the stragglers instead of fighting at the front of the tunnel.</p>
