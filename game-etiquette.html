        <h1>Game Etiquette</h1>
        <p><span class="first-words">Fortnite, as with all multiplayer games, is vulnerable to other players ruining the gaming experience for you and others.</span> Here are some guidelines on how to deal with others and stop yourself from going down this route.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Don't Trade: this is <em>very</em> important!</li>
            <li>If you are going to farm, go into a private match.</li>
            <li>When playing a mission, always contribute to the objective.</li>
            <li>If another player asks you to do something, try to do it.</li>
            <li>Don't horde BluGlo! If you have BluGlo, use it to power up a pylon or power up the objective.</li>
            <li>If you find a survivor in danger, save them. Don't just leave them to die.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="info">
            <p>Your hero has a maximum weapon power level. If you're still in Stonewood and trading for a bunch of &#9735 130 weapons, you won't be able to use them.</p>
        </div>
        <p>The main takeaway for game etiquette is to always contribute to the objective. If you don't help at all, <strong class="warning">you could get reported!</strong></p>
        <p>Another thing to consider is the hero that you are using. A Jess hero, for example, is generally used more for farming than combat or building. Therefore, it is not a good idea to use Jess if you are trying to complete an objective.</p>
